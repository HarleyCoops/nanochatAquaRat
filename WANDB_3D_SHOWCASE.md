```python
from nanochat.wandb_3d_viz import create_3d_attention_visualization
attn_viz = create_3d_attention_visualization(attention_weights, layer_idx=0, head_idx=0)
wandb.log({"3d/attention_layer0_head0": attn_viz})
```

## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Adjusting Buffer Sizes

```python
# In training scripts, modify these lines:

# Larger history for more detailed visualizations
metrics_buffer = TrainingMetricsBuffer(max_size=2000)  # Default: 1000

# More gradient flow snapshots
gradient_buffer = GradientFlowBuffer(num_layers=model.config.n_layer, max_steps=200)  # Default: 100
```

### Custom Visualization Intervals

```python
# Change visualization frequency
eval_every = 30  # Log 3D viz every 30 steps instead of 60
```

### Manual Visualization Creation

```python
from nanochat.wandb_3d_viz import (
    create_3d_loss_landscape,
    create_3d_gradient_flow,
    create_3d_rl_reward_landscape,
    create_3d_loss_gradient_reward_space
)

# Create custom visualization
metrics = metrics_buffer.get_arrays()
custom_fig = create_3d_loss_landscape(metrics, window_size=30)
wandb.log({"custom/my_viz": custom_fig})
```

## 🎓 Scientific Insights from 3D Visualizations

### Loss Landscape Insights

**What to look for**:
- **Smooth surfaces**: Indicate stable training
- **Sharp valleys**: May indicate high learning rate or instability
- **Plateaus**: Suggest learning rate decay or convergence
- **Ridges**: May indicate need for better optimization

### Gradient Flow Insights

**Healthy gradient flow**:
- Gradients decrease gradually from output to input layers
- No layers with zero gradients (vanishing)
- No layers with extremely high gradients (exploding)
- Consistent flow across training

**Warning signs**:
- Layer(s) with persistent near-zero gradients → Add skip connections
- Sudden spikes in specific layers → Gradient clipping may help
- Increasing gradient magnitude over time → Reduce learning rate

### RL Reward Landscape Insights

**Effective RL training**:
- Trajectory moves toward higher rewards
- Loss and reward inversely correlated
- Smooth progression without wild oscillations
- Clear improvement trend over steps

**Potential issues**:
- Reward plateau with decreasing loss → Overfitting policy
- High variance in rewards → Increase num_samples
- Negative correlation breaking → Check reward function

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No visualizations appearing in W&B

**Solutions**:
1. Check that `run != "dummy"` (dummy runs don't log to W&B)
2. Verify you're the master process (rank 0 in distributed training)
3. Check W&B is properly initialized: `wandb.login()`
4. Look for error messages in console output

### Issue: Visualizations are incomplete or empty

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure enough training steps have passed (need >= 50 for loss landscapes)
2. Check buffer sizes are not too small
3. Verify metrics are being tracked correctly (check console logs)
4. For RL visualizations, ensure rewards are being collected

### Issue: Out of memory when generating visualizations

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce buffer sizes: `max_size=500` instead of 1000
2. Reduce gradient tracking frequency
3. Generate visualizations less frequently (increase `eval_every`)
4. Skip gradient flow visualization for very large models

### Issue: Plotly figures not rendering

**Solutions**:
1. Update plotly: `pip install --upgrade plotly`
2. Check W&B version: `pip install --upgrade wandb`
3. Try logging as HTML: `wandb.log({"viz": wandb.Html(fig.to_html())})`

## 🚦 Performance Considerations

### Computational Cost

- **Minimal overhead**: ~0.1-0.5 seconds per visualization generation
- **Memory usage**: ~50-100MB for buffers
- **Network**: 1-5MB per 3D plot uploaded to W&B
- **Frequency**: Only at checkpoint intervals (not every step)

### Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate buffer sizes**: 1000 steps is good for most training runs
2. **Balance frequency vs detail**: `eval_every=60` is a good default
3. **Master process only**: Visualizations only generated on rank 0
4. **Graceful degradation**: Try-except blocks prevent crashes
5. **Lazy generation**: Only create visualizations when needed
